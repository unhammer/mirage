	  	<h5>Documentation</h5>

			<p><b>Usage</b></p>

			<p>The following documentation explains the typical usage of Mirage.

			<p><b><a name="loading">Loading Images</a></b></p>

			<p align="justify">Mirage allows images and folders to be opened from the File menu, by
			double-clicking on an image in a file manager, or by drag-n-drop from a file
			manager.

			<p align="justify">When opening images from the File menu, note that multiple images or directories
			can be selected by holding Ctrl or Shift. When multiple images are loaded, the
			title will display the number of images in the list, i.e. 1 of 47, and the images
			can be easily <a href="#nav">navigated</a>. The File > Open Folder dialog contains
			an additional checkbox to specify whether images in all sub-directories of the
			selected directories should be loaded (recursive).

			<p align="justify">Mirage can also act like other image viewers that load all images in the current
			directory when a single image is selected. This option, as well as other loading
			image behaviors can be found in the <a href="docs-prefs.html#behavior">Preferences</a>.

			<p><b><a name="nav">Navigation</a></b></p>

			<p align="justify">The Go menu contains all of the navigational actions: previous image, next image,
			first image, last image, and random image. Note that, when going to random images,
			Mirage will never show the same random image twice until all images have been viewed
			once. Mirage can also wrap around the list, navigate based on the mousewheel, and
			preload images for faster navigation, as set in the Preferences.

			<p align="justify">Previous/Next Image items are also found in the toolbar and in the right-click
			pop-up when an image is loaded.

			<p align="justify">There is additionally an automated slideshow mode that proceeds to the next image
			after a specified number of seconds. The delay between images, and other options, can
			be specified in the <a href="docs-prefs.html#nav">Preferences</a>.

			<p><b><a name="zoom">Zooming</a></b></p>

			<p align="justify">Mirage provides the most popular zooming actions: zooming in and out, zooming 1:1
			(100%), and zooming to fit. There are various key and mouse shortcuts for zooming
			images - see the listing of shortcuts in the user guide for more
			information on that. Note that all zooming functions will be disabled for animated
			images, as they currently cannot be zoomed.
			</p>

			<p align="justify">The <a href="docs-prefs.html#behavior">Preferences</a> define the default zooming method used for
			loading new images.
			</p>

			<p><b><a name="fullscreen">Fullscreen Mode</a></b></p>

			<p align="justify">Fullscreen can be toggled by using the Shift-Return shortcut or right-clicking
			on the image. When in fullscreen mode, the toolbar and statusbar will automatically
			hide to maximize the displaying of images (the mouse cursor also automatically hides
			after a few seconds of inactivity). Additionally, if you move the mouse cursor
			towards the bottom of the screen, some extra controls will appear: these controls
			provide the ability to navigate forward/back, start/stop a slideshow, and define
			some slideshow options. These slideshow options apply on a one-time basis for
			quickly overriding those specified in the application's Preferences.

			<p align="justify">Fullscreen mode can also be started automatically through the
			<a href="docs-prefs.html#interface">Preferences</a>	or via a
			<a href="docs-advanced.html#cli">commandline argument</a>.</p>

			<p><b><a name="image">Image Manipulation</a></b></p>

			<p align="justify">Currently Mirage supports the following image manipulations: rotating at
			90-degree increments, flipping horizontally/vertically, resizing, cropping, and saturation. Additional
			image manipulations can be supported via <a href="docs-advanced.html#custom">custom actions</a>.
			</p>

			<p align="justify">Rotating and flipping images are simple menu actions. The resize image
			dialog allows the user to specify the size of the new image in pixels and may choose to
			preserve the aspect ratio. The crop image dialog allows	the user to click and drag a
			rectangle around the portion of the image they wish to retain. Saturation allows the user
			to affect the color saturation of the image.
			</p>

			<p>Note that after performing any of these image manipulation actions, the image will be in
			a modified state - the user must then choose to save the image if they wish to make the
			actions permanent. Actions can be auto-saved via the
			<a href="docs-prefs.html#image">Preferences</a>.</p>
