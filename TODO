Next
+ Allow zooming in crop dialog?
+ Try to highlight selected region of cropped image (or darken unselected region)
+ why is light/dark grey no longer used for transparency? (argh)
+ Image effect - saturation
+ mirage --add to add image to current instance instead of opening
  new window
+ Saving image with transparency is messed up

Future
+ Side/bottom pane for thumbnails of all images in list (use .thumbnails?)
	- <md5 of URI>.png, 128x128, in ~/.thumbnails/normal/
	- delete thumbnail if image is deleted, update if image is moved
+ Sorting options (case sensitivity, file10 vs file9, hidden files)? (Michael Campbell)
+ Recent files in file menu (requires new pygtk and gtk 2.10)
	- Recent *viewed* files, not opened
+ Printing support (requires gtk 2.10, pygtk) (Bjoern Martensen)
+ Remove gcc requirement (requires new pygtk)
+ Test on Windows/Mac? (requires new pygtk)
+ Try to make zooming smoother (is this even possible with pygtk?)
