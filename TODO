0.9
+ Allow zooming in crop dialog (default to same view as main window so that
  the user can essentially 'crop visible' by clicking ok right away?)
+ Printing support (requires gtk 2.10, pygtk) (Bjoern Martensen)
+ mirage --add to add image to current instance instead of opening
  new window
+ Pane for thumbnails of all images in list (use .thumbnails?)
	- <md5 of URI>.png, 128x128, in ~/.thumbnails/normal/
	- delete thumbnail if image is deleted, update if image is moved, etc
+ Try to highlight selected region of cropped image (or darken unselected region)
+ Open remote files - use threading...
+ Screenshots (a la gsnapshot) (gtk.gdk.Pixbuf.get_from_drawable)
+ code cleanup... (preload_*, animtest stuff, rename funcs)

Future
+ Ability to specify save compression level?
+ Sorting options (case sensitivity, file10 vs file9, hidden files)? (Michael Campbell)
+ Make gcc requirement optional
+ Test on Windows/Mac? (requires new pygtk)
+ Try to make zooming smoother (is this even possible with pygtk?)
+ why is light/dark grey no longer used for transparency? (argh)
